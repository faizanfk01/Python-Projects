# 🐍 Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my code collection! 👋

This repository is the home for all my **Python projects**. Everything here was built for fun, practice, and experimentation.

All the code here is **Pure Python**. No heavy frameworks or complicated setups—just raw logic and creativity. You will find a variety of scripts ranging from automation tools and small games to logical problem solvers.
